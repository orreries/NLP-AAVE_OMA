# AAVE Usage in Popular Media
This is a repo for my ML/Intro to Programming project analyzing the usage of AAVE (African American Vernacular English) in popular media.

# Project Description: 
This project analyzes the incorporation of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) into popular scripted media.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project will utilize a model to
assess the semantic similarity between around 300 comedy movie scripts and the AAVE
Corpus. An accompanying sentiment analysis to examine the overall positive or negative
usage of AAVE phrases will also be implemented.

# Rationale Statement: 
This project is being used to interrogate the way that AAVE is assimilated into the wider English lexicon. AAVE
terms have been adopted into the wider English vocabulary with many ignorant to the fact
that their creation and usage originated in Black communities. Many of the instances AAVE is
being used by individuals outside of Black communities it is used improperly and in a manner
that is flippant usually in the context of a joke, or being the joke itself. This type of flagrant
usage of AAVE has been coined digital blackface.
workflow: identifies libraries used and explains the important steps being taken in the
code.

# Further Study:  
Future research with this work could be to map the wider flow of AAVE adoption into the popular
English lexicon. This work could augment a temporal analysis of when AAVE usage has
become more commonly used in media. This project could easily be expanded to cover other
types of media (e.g., more genres of film, investigate TV episode scripts, help analyze trends
in books). It could also be used as a tool to analyze memes and social trends to see if there is
significant AAVE usage and if the context in which it’s used is correct.

# Files List: 

a list of files relevant to the project (python notebooks, csv files, etc) and a brief
description of what each file contains

A note about formatting: except the title and list of files, each of these items should have about a
paragraph (3-5 sentences) of text. The readme is generally written in Markdown, but it can also be
written in plain text .txt.
